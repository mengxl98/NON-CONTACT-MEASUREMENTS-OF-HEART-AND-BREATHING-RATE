# NON-CONTACT-MEASUREMENTS-OF-HEART-AND-BREATHING-RATE

Respiratory rate and heart rate are one of the most important indicators of human body, which are also the basis for the diagnosis of some diseases, such as the diagnosis of sleep disorders. More attention is paid to the sleep disorders which can seriously affect peopleâ€™s mental and physical health, causing a variety of social problems. However, at present, the contact measurements for human physiological signals are the most common methods, which need the contact with human skin by electrodes or other devices attached in order to obtain signals. The contact methods reduce the comfort of patients and are not suitable for long-term measurement. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop a non-contact measurement system for human physiological signal that can be applied when patients are sleeping. In our research, a dual-mode non-contact measurement system for human physiological signals is proposed. The respiratory rate and heart rate of the tested subjects are extracted through near-infrared images and far-infrared images.
